# CodeGen README

Instead of Search & Replace, this extension is to allow you to create similar lines of code that vary. Provide a list of comma seperated values, and a line of code with %%% wherever you want the value inserted, and for each of the list items, it will generate a corresponding line of code.

## Features

Quick and easy generation of lines of code to eliminate the need for manual copying and pasting.
